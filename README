This is the S-ACOT-MPS code to calculate cross sections for the heavy-flavor hadroproduction
Please cite K. Xie, J. Campbell, P. Nadolsky, arXiv:1910.xxxxx

We have the LHAPDF format for residual and subtracted PDF
CT14nnlo_res  CT14nnlo_sub  CT18NNLO_res  CT18NNLO_sub

The Flavor Creation (FC), Flavor Excitation (FE) and Subtraction example are demonstrated.

Usage:

1. Compile the MCFM code:
cd mcfm
make

2. Place the PDF files in your LHAPDF directory
mv CT* $(lhapdf-config --datadir)

3 Calculate the FC, FE and SB terms with the example file
cd mcfm/Bin
./run.sh

4. compile the plotter code and plot the results
cd plotter
make
cd ..
./plotter/plot.sh LHCbBX
